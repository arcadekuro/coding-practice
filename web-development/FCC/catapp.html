    <h1> Hello world</h1> 
    A better way to apply syles of an element is to use CSS. 
    This can be done by using a style block.

    Other than standard fonts, you can also specify  non-standard, 
    custom web fonts from google fonts. 
    To import a Google Font, you can copy the font(s) URL from the Google Fonts library and then paste it in your HTML. To this ceate a link element with the href linking to the webpage.(before the style element)
    -->

    <!-- There are several default fonts that are available in all browsers. These  generic font families include monospace, serif and sans-serif
    When one font isn't available, you can tell the browser to "degrade" to another font.  Generic font family names are not case-sensitive. Also, they do not need quotes   because they are CSS keywords.

    if it's a class element use a dot in front. i.e .smaller-image

    border radius gives a rounded corner. 50% - makes it circular

    in addition to classes, each HTML elemt can also have an id attibute.
     id to style a single element and later you'll learn that you can use them to select and modify specific elements with JavaScript. They should be unique. Don't give more than one element the same id attribute.

     Note that inside your style element, you always reference classes by putting a . in front of their names. You always reference ids by putting a # in front of their names.

<!-- 
classes are reusable tyles that can be added to HTML elemnts.
The same class can be used on multiple elements.

CSS borders have properties like style, color and width.
you can apply multiple classes to an element using its class attribute, by separating each class name with a space. For example:

<img class="class1 class2">

you can also size your images using the CCS property called width.

we've been using id or class to elements, which are known as ID and class Selectors. 
There are other CSS selectors. The [attr=value] slector matches and styles elements with a specific attribute value. 

ids, overide class, buy inline element can overide id.Remember, in line styles look like this:

<h1 style="color: green;">

    when you absolutely need to be sure that an element has specific CSS, you can use !important. i.e color: red !important;

        <!--
            Fields can also be specified as required input using <input type="text" required>
            Radio buttons are another type of input. Each button can be nested within its ownb label element. It's best practice to set a for attribute on the label element with a value that matches the value of id attribute of the input element. 
            checkboxes are an additional input.

            When a form gets submitted, the data is sent to the server and includes entries for the options selected. Inputs of type radio and checkbox report their values from the value attribute.

            If you omit the value attribute, the submitted form data uses the default value, which is on. In this scenario, if the user clicked the "indoor" option and submitted the form, the resulting form data would be indoor-outdoor=on, which is not useful. So the value attribute needs to be set to something to identify the option.

            You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute.
            <input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>

<!--
    a (anchor) elements can also be used to create internal links to jump to different sections within a webpage.

    examples:
    <a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>
    <h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>
    
    To create an internal link, you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for the element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page. You then need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.
