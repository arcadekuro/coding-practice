          </form>
       
        <!--
            Fields can also be specified as required input using <input type="text" required>
            Radio buttons are another type of input. Each button can be nested within its ownb label element. It's best practice to set a for attribute on the label element with a value that matches the value of id attribute of the input element. 
            checkboxes are an additional input.

            When a form gets submitted, the data is sent to the server and includes entries for the options selected. Inputs of type radio and checkbox report their values from the value attribute.

            If you omit the value attribute, the submitted form data uses the default value, which is on. In this scenario, if the user clicked the "indoor" option and submitted the form, the resulting form data would be indoor-outdoor=on, which is not useful. So the value attribute needs to be set to something to identify the option.

            You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute.
            <input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>

<!--
    a (anchor) elements can also be used to create internal links to jump to different sections within a webpage.

    examples:
    <a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>
    <h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>
    
    To create an internal link, you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for the element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page. You then need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.
