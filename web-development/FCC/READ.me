# Learning

## Input Elements
 Input elements are convenient way to get input from your user.
 `<input type="text">`
 you can also create a form that has the input nested undearneath.
 Placeholder text is what is displayed in your input element before your user has inputed anything using `placeholder="this is placeholder text">`

Fields can also be specified as required input using <input type="text" required>
Radio buttons are another type of input. Each button can be nested withinits ownb label element. It's best practice to set a for attribute on thelabel element with a value that matches the value of id attribute of theinput element. 

checkboxes are an additional input.
When a form gets submitted, the data is sent to the server and includes
entries for the options selected. Inputs of type radio and checkbox report their values from the value attribute.

If you omit the value attribute, the submitted form data uses the default value, which is on. In this scenario, if the user clicked the "indoor"option and submitted the form, the resulting form data would beindoor-outdoor=on, which is not useful. So the value attribute needs to beset to something to identify the option.

You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using thechecked attribute.
`<input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>`


## Overiding CSS libraries

Sometimes our HTML elements will receive multiple styles that conflict with one another.

For example, your h1 element can't be both green and pink at the same time. classes will overide styles set to html elements. 

If two classes are given, the browser reads top to bottom and use whicever CSS decleration  comes last. Like in python.

you can also overide your css class by adding an id.


You can apply multiple classes to an element using its class attribute, by separating each class name with a space. For example:

`<img class="class1 class2">`

ID or class to elements are known as ID and class Selectors. 
There are other CSS selectors. The [attr=value] slector matches and styles elements with a specific attribute value. 

In many situations, you will use CSS libraries. These may accidentally override your own CSS. So when you absolutely need to be sure that an element has specific CSS, you can use !important


## Representing colors in CSS.
There are other ways to represent colours such as hexidecimal code. hexadecimal(hex) are bas 16 numbers - it uses sixteen distinct symbols. 
Like decimals, the symbols 0-9 represent the values zero to nine. Then A,B,C,D,E,F represent the values ten to fifteen. Altogether, 0 to F can represent a digit in hexadecimal, giving us 16 total possible values. 

In CSS, we can use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components. For example, #000000 is black and is also the lowest possible value. 

### Using Hex Code to Mix colors. 
From these three pure colors (red, green, and blue), we can vary the amounts of each to create over 16 million other colors.
For example, orange is pure red, mixed with some green, and no blue. In hex code, this translates to being `#FFA500`.

The digit `0` is the lowest number in hex code, and represents a complete absence of color.

The digit `F` is the highest number in hex code, and represents the maximum possible brightness.

| colours       | Hex code      | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Dodger Blue   | #1E90FF       | 
| Green         | #00FF00       | 
| Orange        | #FFA500       |
| Red           | #FF0000       |

It can be difficult to remember hex code, but fortunately it can be shortened. #FFOOOO
can be shortened to #F00. 

This reduces the total number of possible colors to around 4,000. But browsers will interpret #FF0000 and #F00 as exactly the same color.

| Color  | Short Hex code |
| ------ |:--------------:|
| Cyan   | #0FF           |
| Green  | #0F0           |
| Red    | #F00           |
| Fuchsia| #F0F           |

### Using RGB valuesAnother way you can represent colors in CSS is by using RGB values.

The RGB value for black looks like this:

rgb(0, 0, 0)

The RGB value for white looks like this:

rgb(255, 255, 255)

Instead of using six hexadecimal digits like you do with hex code, with RGB you specify the brightness of each color with a number between 0 and 255.

`body {
  background-color: rgb(255, 165, 0);
}`
