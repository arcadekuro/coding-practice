# Anywhere there is quotations then we are defining a string. A string means a series of characters. * -
# multiplication operator and we're multiplying the string by the number. So the output will be produced by number of
# times multiplied.
# The '*' * 10 part of line 5 is called an expression. This means code that produces a value.
# When the python interpreter tries to execute line 4. it will first evaluate the code we put in between paranthesis.

# Variables - fundamental for programming. They are used to temporarily store data in a computers
# memory.
# Example:
price = 10
price = 20  # This updates it, because the python code interprets line by line from the top.

# When the interpreter executes this code, it will allocate some memory and then store the number 10 in that memory.
# Then it will attach a price label in the memory location.
# As a metaphor - A box with number 10 inside, and price is the label put on the box.
# Now we can use the label/variable anywhere in our program to access the value that we have in that box.

print(price)
# Notice there are no quotation. Because if there were only the text would be printed. Not the variable value

# This is how we define variables.
# Start with an identifier - name of the variable.
# Then and equals sign, and a value.
# The value is first converted to it's binary form presentation.
# Number 10 is  in the decimal system which is all digits from 0 to 9.
# First converted to binary 2 be stored.

# The numbers above are integers because they do not have a decimal point.

# Boolean is a value that is true or false. See below. An _ separates multiple words in a variable
